-- Fix forms not accepting responses and add debugging
-- This script ensures all forms are properly configured to accept responses

-- First, let's check the current state of forms
-- You can run this query to see which forms are not accepting responses:
-- SELECT id, title, accepting_responses, form_privacy, published, submission_deadline, max_responses
-- FROM forms 
-- WHERE accepting_responses IS NULL OR accepting_responses = false;

-- Update all existing forms to accept responses by default
UPDATE forms 
SET accepting_responses = true 
WHERE accepting_responses IS NULL OR accepting_responses = false;

-- Update all forms to be published if they have an internship_id but aren't published
UPDATE forms 
SET published = true 
WHERE internship_id IS NOT NULL 
  AND (published IS NULL OR published = false);

-- Make sure form_privacy is set properly for application forms
UPDATE forms 
SET form_privacy = 'public' 
WHERE internship_id IS NOT NULL 
  AND (form_privacy IS NULL OR form_privacy = 'private');

-- Create a debug function to help identify why forms aren't accepting responses
