# üöÄ InternX Collaboration Workflow Guide

## **Overview**
This guide outlines how you and your co-founder should collaborate on the InternX project to avoid conflicts and ensure quality code deployment.

## **üèóÔ∏è Branch Strategy**

### **Main Branches**
- `main` - Production-ready code only
- `develop` - Integration branch for testing features together

### **Feature Branches**
- `feature/your-feature-name` - For your development work
- `feature/co-founder-feature-name` - For your co-founder's work
- `hotfix/urgent-fix` - For critical production fixes

## **üìã Daily Workflow**

### **1. Starting Your Day**
```bash
# Always start with latest code
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create new feature branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### **2. During Development**
```bash
# Make your changes
# Test locally with: npm run dev

# Commit frequently with clear messages
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add specific feature description"
```

### **3. Before Pushing**
```bash
# Ensure your branch is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase main

# Push your feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## **üîÑ Testing & Deployment Strategy**

### **Individual Testing (Local)**
```bash
# Test your changes locally first
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
```

### **Feature Branch Testing (Vercel Preview)**
1. Push your feature branch to GitHub
2. Vercel automatically creates a preview deployment
3. Test your changes in isolation
4. Share preview URL with co-founder for review

### **Integration Testing (Develop Branch)**
1. Create Pull Request to `develop` branch
2. Both developers review and test together
3. Resolve conflicts collaboratively
4. Merge to `develop` when both approve

### **Production Testing (Main Branch)**
1. Create Pull Request from `develop` to `main`
2. Final review and testing
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor for any issues

## **üö® Conflict Resolution**

### **When Conflicts Occur**
1. **Don't panic!** Conflicts are normal in collaboration
2. Both developers should be present to resolve conflicts
3. Use `git status` to see conflicting files
4. Open conflicting files and look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers

### **Resolving Conflicts**
```bash
# During rebase or merge, conflicts will be marked
git status  # See conflicting files

# Edit files to resolve conflicts
# Remove conflict markers and keep best code

# After resolving
git add .
git rebase --continue  # or git merge --continue
```

## **üì± Vercel Deployment Strategy**

### **Preview Deployments (Feature Branches)**
- Each feature branch gets automatic preview deployment
- Test your changes in isolation
- Share preview URL for review

### **Production Deployment (Main Branch)**
- Only deploy from `main` branch
- Use Vercel's automatic deployment
- Monitor deployment logs for errors

## **üîÑ Complete Workflow Example**

### **Your Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/ai-accuracy-system

# 2. Develop and test locally
# Make changes, test with npm run dev

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add AI accuracy tracking"
git push origin feature/ai-accuracy-system

# 4. Create PR to develop branch
# Test integration with co-founder's changes

# 5. After approval, merge to develop
# Test develop branch together

# 6. Create PR from develop to main
# Final testing and production deployment
```

### **Co-Founder's Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/co-founder-feature

# 2. Develop and test locally
# Make changes, test with npm run dev

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add co-founder's feature"
git push origin feature/co-founder-feature

# 4. Create PR to develop branch
# Test integration with your changes

# 5. After approval, merge to develop
# Test develop branch together

# 6. Create PR from develop to main
# Final testing and production deployment
```

## **üîß Tools & Commands Reference**

### **Essential Git Commands**
```bash
git status                    # Check repository status
git log --oneline            # View commit history
git branch                   # List branches
git checkout -b branch-name  # Create and switch to new branch
git rebase main             # Update feature branch with main
git merge branch-name        # Merge branch into current
git pull origin main        # Get latest changes
git push origin branch-name # Push branch to remote
```

### **Vercel Commands**
```bash
vercel                        # Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod               # Deploy to production
vercel ls                   # List deployments
```

## **üìû Communication Protocol**

### **Before Starting Work**
- Inform co-founder what you're working on
- Check if they're working on related files
- Coordinate on shared components

### **During Development**
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Push feature branches regularly
- Use descriptive branch names

### **Before Merging**
- Both developers must review code
- Test integration together
- Resolve conflicts collaboratively
- Ensure all tests pass

### **After Deployment**
- Monitor production for issues
- Communicate any problems immediately
- Plan next development cycle

## **üöÄ Getting Started Right Now**

### **For You (Already Done):**
‚úÖ Feature branch created: `feature/ai-accuracy-system`

### **Next Steps:**
1. Create Pull Request to `develop` branch
2. Ask co-founder to review your changes
3. Test integration when co-founder pushes their changes
4. Merge to `develop` after testing
5. Create final PR to `main` for production

### **For Your Co-Founder:**
1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/Chasekung/internx-new.git`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/their-feature-name`
3. Make changes and test locally
